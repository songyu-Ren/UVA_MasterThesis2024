Abstract	

Financial time series forecasting is crucial for informed decision-making in stock markets. However, traditional models often struggle to capture the complex dynamics in financial data. This research analyzes financial time series forecasting for two S&P 500 companies, beginning with a statistical decomposition using STL to evaluate stock explainability. It compares traditional models (ARIMA and ETS) and advanced methods (LSTM, N-Beats) with conformal prediction (CP) to an integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNN utilizes extensive historical price and financial indicators data to capture market dynamics. CP transforms the output of any black box prediction algorithm into a prediction set enhancing the explainability and reliability of the output. Integration of GNN and CP bridges the research gap in current research. The methodology includes data preprocessing, model optimization, and evaluation of point and distributed forecasting. The findings confirm that incorporating graph-based representations and temporal relationships can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions, contributing to the advancement of deep learning in financial time series forecasting.
